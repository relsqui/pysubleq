pysubleq
--------
is an emulator for a processor that only implements one instruction.

### subleq ###
The one instruction is subleq: "subtract, and branch if less than or equal to zero." Its operands are three memory addresses (a, b, c). For each instruction, subleq subtracts the value at address a from the value at address b, and stores the result at address b. If that result is negative, execution jumps to address c; otherwise it proceeds to the next instruction. If c is omitted, execution always proceeds to the next instruction.

### writing and running programs ###
pysubleq programs have separate data and instruction memory; the data registers are numbered from zero, and the instruction registers are numbered from zero *in triplets* (that is, by line, rather than by operand).

The first line in a program file may have any amount of integers in it, separated by spaces; this initializes the data registers. All following lines are taken as sets of operands to the subleq operator. Blank lines and lines starting with # are ignored. Example:


```
2 5 0

0 2
2 1
2 2
```

This program initializes the memory registers to [2, 5, 0], and then performs the subleq operation three times: on registers 0 and 2, then 2 and 1, then 2 and 2.

pysubleq reads programs from stdin or any filenames you specify. If the above example was in a file called `add`, you could do `subleq.py add` and get this:

```
[2, 5, 0]
(0, 2)
[2, 5, -2]
(2, 1)
[2, 7, -2]
(2, 2)
[2, 7, 0]
```

For each instruction executed, pysubleq shows the memory state before and after as well as the operands for that instruction. The example program has added the value in register 0 to the value in register 1.
